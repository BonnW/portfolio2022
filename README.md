# Frontend Details for Portfolio

Frontend built with React and Material UI. 

The inspiration for this came from the origin on the wallpaper. This lofi hiphop channel has been a constant companion during my journy into the world of software engineering. I knew that I wanted to implement and show my appreciation of this channel to my very personal portfolio project. This Portfolio is meant to be an easy way for me add/delete projects and blog posts through the webapp. Doing everything from scratch is my way to showcase skills by implementing both frontend, backend and Dev Ops technologies.

# Backend Details for Portfolio

This API will communicate with a mongodb server in order to implement the "About Me" and "Projects" section. 

# About Me

About Me is a pseudo blog. Enter posts directly from the web page and save posts to mongoDB. Posts will list and display in the Popover.

# Projects

Projects will be displayed in two parts. The top half will be shown as a small progress header displaying "Just Finished" => "Currently Working On" => "Future Project". The bottom half will show a list of projects. I will be able to update all projects within the webapp.
